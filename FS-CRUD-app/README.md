Overview
This is an Dockerized and authentication-protected Todo App using Node.js, Express.js, bcrypt, JWT authentication, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The app allows users to:

Register: Create a new account.
Login: Authenticate and receive a JWT token.
Manage Todos: Perform auth protected CRUD operations on their own todo tasks after logging in.
Project Structure
Here’s the corrected and complete project structure diagram for the auth-protected Todo App:

Explanation of Key Directories and Files
prisma/: Contains Prisma's schema (schema.prisma) and migration files. After each schema change, migration files are generated here to apply database changes.
public/: Contains the frontend HTML file. This file interacts with the backend API for user registration, login, and todo management.
src/: The core backend code.
controllers/ (optional): A directory to organize logic and separate it from the routes if needed in the future.
middlewares/: Contains middleware for handling JWT-based authentication, protecting routes that require authentication.
routes/: Contains API routes for handling authentication and CRUD operations for todos.
prismaClient.js: Sets up the Prisma client for database interaction.
server.js: The entry point for the Express.js application, which configures the app, routes, and middleware.
.env: Stores environment variables like DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET. These variables are used to configure Prisma, JWT, and database connections.
Dockerfile: The Dockerfile for building the Node.js application in a containerized environment.
docker-compose.yaml: Configuration for Docker Compose, which sets up both the Node.js app and PostgreSQL in separate containers.
package.json: Defines the Node.js dependencies and scripts used to run the application (e.g., npm start).
README.md: Project documentation, including setup instructions and directory structure (this file).
Example Workflow
Define or Update Schema: Modify the schema.prisma file to change your database structure.
Create Migrations: Use Prisma to generate and apply migrations.
Run Docker Compose: Build and run the Node.js app and PostgreSQL using Docker Compose.
Interact with the API: Use the frontend or API client (e.g., Postman) to register, login, and manage todos.
This project structure and workflow will help organize your code and make it easier to maintain and scale as your application grows.
